# Project31
The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) in the problem of detecting objects using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

## ToDo:
  * ~~CNN_HOG.ipynb implementation in google colab~~
  * ~~CNN_HOG.ipynb adding HOG layer~~
  * model tuning
  * keras-to-cpp [https://github.com/pplonski/keras2cpp]
  * try to use INRIA dataset annotations
