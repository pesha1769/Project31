# Project31
The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) in the problem of detecting objects using convolutional neural networks (CNN).

## ToDo:
  * ~~val_acc is higher than acc~~
  * ~~CNN_HOG.ipynb implementation in google colab~~
  * ~~CNN_HOG.ipynb adding HOG layer~~
  * ~~model tuning for better detection~~
  * ?try to use INRIA dataset annotations 
  * ~~DET-graphs FAR/FRR~~
  * ?keras-to-cpp [https://github.com/pplonski/keras2cpp]
